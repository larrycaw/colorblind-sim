## 👁️ Understanding Colorblindness

Colorblindness (color vision deficiency) affects approximately **8% of males** and **0.5% of females** worldwide. It occurs when certain cells in the retina, called cones, are missing or don't work properly. There are three main types of cones, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light:

### 🎨 Types of Colorblindness

#### **🔴 Protanopia (Red-Blind)**

- **What it is**: Missing or non-functioning red cones (L-cones)
- **How it affects vision**:
  - Red colors appear darker and may be confused with black
  - Difficulty distinguishing between red and green colors
  - Red traffic lights may appear dim or off
  - Red text on green backgrounds is nearly invisible
- **Prevalence**: Affects approximately 1% of males
- **Inheritance**: X-linked recessive (more common in males)

#### **🟢 Deuteranopia (Green-Blind)**

- **What it is**: Missing or non-functioning green cones (M-cones)
- **How it affects vision**:
  - Most common type of colorblindness
  - Difficulty distinguishing between red and green colors
  - Green colors may appear gray or brown
  - Red and green traffic lights may look similar
  - Difficulty reading color-coded charts and graphs
- **Prevalence**: Affects approximately 6% of males
- **Inheritance**: X-linked recessive (more common in males)

#### **🔵 Tritanopia (Blue-Blind)**

- **What it is**: Missing or non-functioning blue cones (S-cones)
- **How it affects vision**:
  - Difficulty distinguishing between blue and yellow colors
  - Blue colors may appear gray or green
  - Yellow colors may appear light gray or white
  - Difficulty with blue-yellow color combinations
  - May also affect perception of red and green
- **Prevalence**: Very rare, affects less than 1% of the population
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant (affects males and females equally)

### **⚫ Monochromacy (Complete Colorblindness)**

- **What it is**: Only one type of cone or no cones at all
- **How it affects vision**:
  - Sees only in shades of gray
  - Extremely rare
  - Often accompanied by other vision problems

### **🔍 Colorblindness vs. Normal Vision**

| Aspect               | 👁️ Normal Vision            | 🎨 Colorblind Vision                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Color Range**      | Full spectrum               | Limited spectrum                        |
| **Traffic Lights**   | Clear red/green distinction | May appear similar                      |
| **Color-coded Info** | Easy to read                | Difficult to interpret                  |
| **Art & Design**     | Full appreciation           | Limited color perception                |
| **Daily Tasks**      | No color-related issues     | May struggle with color-dependent tasks |

### **🌍 Real-World Impact**

Colorblindness affects many aspects of daily life:

- **🚗 Transportation**: Difficulty with traffic signals and color-coded maps
- **📚 Education**: Problems with color-coded charts, graphs, and educational materials
- **💼 Work**: Challenges in fields requiring color discrimination (electrical work, design, etc.)
- **💻 Technology**: Difficulty with color-coded interfaces and accessibility features
- **⚠️ Safety**: Problems with color-coded safety systems and warnings

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### 🔢 Color Transformation Matrix

The application uses 3x3 transformation matrices to simulate colorblindness:

```typescript
// Deuteranopia matrix
[
  [0.625, 0.375, 0],
  [0.7, 0.3, 0],
  [0, 0.3, 0.7],
][
  // Protanopia matrix
  [0.567, 0.433, 0],
  [0.558, 0.442, 0],
  [0, 0.242, 0.758]
][
  // Tritanopia matrix
  [0.95, 0.05, 0],
  [0, 0.433, 0.567],
  [0, 0.475, 0.525]
];
```

### 🎨 Canvas Processing

- Images are loaded into HTML5 Canvas
- Pixel data is processed using transformation matrices
- Real-time rendering with split slider functionality
